/// `SpyableMacro` is an implementation of the `Spyable` macro, which generates a test spy class
/// for the protocol to which the macro is added.
///
/// The macro uses an `Extractor` to ensure that the `@Spyable` attribute is being used correctly, i.e., it is
/// applied to a protocol declaration. If the attribute is not applied to a protocol, an error is thrown.
///
/// After verifying the protocol, `SpyableMacro` uses a `SpyFactory` to generate a new spy class declaration
/// that implements the given protocol and records interactions with its methods and properties. The resulting
/// class is added to the source file, thus "expanding" the `@Spyable` attribute into this new declaration.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// @Spyable
/// protocol ServiceProtocol {
///     func fetch(text: String, count: Int) async -> Decimal
/// }
/// ```
/// This will generate a `ServiceProtocolSpy` class that implements `ServiceProtocol` and records method calls.
